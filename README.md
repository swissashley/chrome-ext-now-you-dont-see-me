## Chrome extension - Now You (don't) See Me

### Background

Sometimes I don't feel comfortable letting people see the content I am currently browsing when they passing by. Whenever you want to hide all of your tabs,this Chrome extension will help you to close all the tabs, save them into a temporary bookmark folder, and restore them later with one button.

### Functionality & MVP

With this extension, users will be able to:

- [ ] Hide ( & bookmark) all the tabs with one click.
- [ ] Restore ( & remove the temporary bookmarks) all the tabs with one click.
- [ ] Use Hotkey to hide & restore.
- [ ] Open your preset homepage when hiding all the tabs.
- [ ] Use password to restore the tabs.

### Technologies & Technical Challenges

This extension will be implemented using the standard Chrome extension technology: Javascript, with chrome API.  In addition to the `manifest.json` and `package.json` files, there will be two scripts:

- `content.js`: will contain the logic hiding and restoring all the tabs.
- `options.js`: will contain the logic for changing the user's settings

There will also be one HTML file to display the settings:

- `options.html`: the file that renders the Settings menu for the user

The primary technical challenges will be:

- Accessing the tabs,
- Creating temporary bookmarks,
- Opening up homepage,
- Building modal ( or html page) and prompt for password.
